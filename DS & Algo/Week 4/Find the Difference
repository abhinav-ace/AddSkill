'''
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

#Python3

Time Complexity- O(l logl) where l is the length of string t.
Space Complexity- O(1)

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        
        res = 0
        
        #ord gives us the ascii value of a character.
        #res holds the final xor value of all the character and since t will cancel all the characters in s only 1 will be left that will be our anser.
        for letter in s:
            res^=ord(letter)
            
        for letter in t:
            res^=ord(letter)
            
        return chr(res)
