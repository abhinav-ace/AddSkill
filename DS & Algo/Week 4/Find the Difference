'''
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

Time Complexity- O(l logl) where l is the length of string t.
Space Complexity- O(1)

    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        
        s=''.join(sorted(s))
        t=''.join(sorted(t))
        
        #Sorting both the strings and comparing the unequal character.
